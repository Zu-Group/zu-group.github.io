## Directions
On the Autopista (highway) Próspero Fernández, route 27, from San José via Escazú heading toward Santa Ana, take the Guachepelín exit which is the next exit after you pass the Multiplaza shopping mall on your left (don’t worry: you can’t miss it). Go right at the end of the off-ramp (you’ll see the Construplaza hardware store on your left) and immediately take another right. Follow the paved road up the hill and the church entrance is on your left.
